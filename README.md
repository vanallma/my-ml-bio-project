# my-ml-bio-project

This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques in the field of bioinformatics to aid in drug discovery. The project involves collecting and preprocessing bioactivity data from the ChEMBL database, as well as the computation of molecular descriptors using the Padel Descriptor software. The collected dataset is then used to build regression models for predicting the potency of compounds against a target protein, specifically acetylcholine esterase.
